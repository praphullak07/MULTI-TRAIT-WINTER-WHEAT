METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: Around 20 g of grain sample from each of 280 genotype from GWAS panel were used for phenotyping GFeC and GZnC through high-throughput Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) machine (model X-Supreme 8000; Oxford Instruments plc, Abingdon, United Kingdom) calibrated with glass beads-based values. To record TKW, the Numigral grain counter was used to count the grain number, the reading was set at 1000 grains and the weight of the grains was recorded in grams with an electronic balance. The genotypes were genotyped using Axiom Wheat Breeder’s Genotyping Array (Aﬀymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) having 35,143 genome-wide SNPs.

Methods for processing the data: The GWAS panel of 280 genotypes were genotyped using Axiom Wheat Breeder’s Genotyping Array (Aﬀymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) having 35,143 genome-wide SNPs. The monomorphic, markers with minor allele frequency (MAF) of <5%, missing data of >20%, and heterozygote frequency >25% were removed from the analysis. The remaining set of 14,790 high-quality SNPs was used in GWAS analysis.

Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: R package ‘augmentedRCBD’, Trait Analysis by aSSociation Evolution and Linkage (TASSEL) version 5.0, STRUCURE, STRUCTURE HARVESTER, BLINK (Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway) model, Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) version 3.0 in R software package.

Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) machine (model X-Supreme 8000; Oxford Instruments plc, Abingdon, United Kingdom) calibrated with glass beads-based values.

Environmental/experimental conditions: Well irrigated and optimal condition with standard package of practices.

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: Nil
